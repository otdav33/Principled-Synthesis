volume
pitch (for base frequency)
duration
harmonic/overtone series type (all (ideal string), evens, odds (ideal closed tube), free bar, fixed bar, tympani??? , circular drum (1+1.3n)f0???, ideal circular membrane?, ideal golden ratio rectangular membrane?, etc) (maybe start with sliders for even, odd, fixed bar, free bar and random since membranes are uncommon note instruments)
uhh: strings and open cylinders usually vibrate uniformly on even and odd harmonics, clarinets (one-end closed cylinders) have mostly only odd harmonics, and bassoons generally have a bias toward even harmonics, etc
volume of undertones as a percent of overtone volume (100% for horns, 0% for strings)
first audible tone harmonic number (0 for sting instruments, 4 for xylophones, no lower bound for horns)
shimmeryness (how self-consistent the base and overtone frequencies are)
initial noisiness (common in percussion instruments)
individual harmonic unsteadyness (how much frequencies increase/decrease on account of random noise)
total unsteadyness (how much the entire sound increases/decreases randomly)
rate of loss of higher frequency harmonics compared to lower frequency harmonics with note volume decay (a frequency may have 1/2 the life of the one 100Hz below it)
rate of exponential decay of the sound overall
amount of time spent as noise before clarifying into note harmonic frequencies (for free bells and blocks and things)
initial harmonic amplitude distribution (which harmonic frequencies are loudest) (B(v) = a*v^3/(e^(v/c)-1) where c = base_frequency/2.82143937 and a = desired_level/(base_frequency^3/(e^(base_frequence/c)-1)) where desired_level is the desired amplitude of the strongest harmonic.
comeup time
comedown time
just vs pythagorean tuning?
amount of octave stretching?
roughness?? -- chance for there to be a random bout of noise
wetness?? ambient fluid viscocity?? -- squishes frequencies downwards and adds noise
maybe a whole bunch of different flavors of noise??
